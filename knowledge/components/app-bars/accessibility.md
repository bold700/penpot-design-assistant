- Understand what page they’re currently visiting
- Take actions or navigate to a new page destination
- Maintain access to app bar actions when the content is scrolled

## Interaction & style


### Touch

When tapping on an icon button, a touch ripple appears, indicating interaction feedback.
Touch: Tap

### Cursor

When hovered, the hover state provides a visual cue to the user that the element is interactive.
When clicked (in both active and inactive states), a ripple appears to indicate feedback.
Cursor: Hover, Click

### Keyboard or switch

When navigating to an interactive element, a focus indicator appears to show that action can be taken.
When the element is selected, an action is then performed.
Interactive elements should have focus rings

### Initial focus

Focus should initially land on the leading button, since it’s the first interactive element of the app bar.

On darker backgrounds, search bar containers can use the surface bright role to maintain strong visual contrast.
If mapping to other color roles, make sure the text and container have 3:1 contrast to ensure readability.
